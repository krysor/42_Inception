MANDATORY {

x READ:
x 1. daemons + how they work
x 2. PID 1
x 3. best practices for writing DockerFiles

Steps:
x 1. use a Virtual Machine
x 2. all conf files in srcs/
x 3. Makefile must set up entire application
x 4. use "docker compose"
x 5. each Docker image same name as corresponding service
x 6. each service runs in dedicated container
x 7. containers built from penultimate stable Debian/Alpine
x 8. write own "Dockerfiles", one per service
x 9. Dockerfiles must get called in "docker-compose.yml" in Makefile

Set up:
x 1. docker container w/ NGINX with TLSv1.2 / v1.3
2. docker container w/ WordPress + php-fpm (installed and configured) (w/o NGINX !!!)
x 3. docker container w/ MariaDB (w/o NGINX !!!)
4. volume w/ WordPress database
5. volume 2 w/ WordPress website files
6. docker-network that establishes connection between containers

DO NOT:
0. pull ready-made Docker images
1. use DockerHub (except Debian/Alpine)
2. use patch based on 'tail -f', 'bash', 'sleep infinity', 'while true'
3. use network: host or --link
4. start containers with command running an inf loop (same for any cmd in entrypoint (scripts))
5. use "latest" tag
6. put password in Dockerfiles
7. include .env or README!!!

DO:
x 0. file structure in example
1. WordPress DB: 2 users of which 1 admin (admin username can't contain "admin")
x 2. volumes available in "/home/login/data" folder of the host machine (login=kkaczoro) 
x 3. configure domain name so it points to local IP address
x 4. domain name = login.42.fr (replace login)
x 5. use environment variables
x 6. store environment variables in .env file
x 7. NGINX container = the only entrypoint (via the port 443 using TLSv1.2 / 1.3)
x 8. store creditentials, API keys, environment variables in .env IGNORED by git

9. include a "network line" in the docker-compose.yml 
10. container have to restart in case of crash !!!

} END MANDATORY
